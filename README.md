Instructions:

1. Clone the repo with `heroku git:clone -a fast-falls-60036`
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. To run the app locally, run `heroku local web`.
4. To open the version running on heroku, run `heroku open`
5. To deploy to heroku, run `git push heroku master`
6. Keep this git repo and the one on heroku in sync (i.e. push to both). I know this is annoying but it's too much work to set up automatically.
7. If you run it locally and key errors on undefined errors, ask Ethan for help because you're probably missing config variable definitions (which define keys that we don't want to post publicly).
8. If you don't have an heroku account, make one and send Ethan the email you used to register so he can add you as a collaborator.
